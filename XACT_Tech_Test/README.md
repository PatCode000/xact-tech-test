# Tech test for XACT

## Application can be tested using DebugTest in the method to test single method in Program.cs

## Application can be tested using DebugTest in the class to test all methods in Program.cs

### There might be mistake in the task document. Example tables indicates maximum deviation in the Minimum column, and minimum deviation in Maximum column. If for some reason the tables should be generated as example indicates, two methods should be swapped with their algorithms (MathCalculations.GetMinimum & MathCalculations.GetMaximum).

### I will appreciate any feedback, as this could help me improving my skills, and also avoid using bad practice in the future.
